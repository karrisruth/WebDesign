 <h2> Web Design and Me </h2>
  <p> I was first motivated to learn more about Web Design when I joined Galvanize in September of 2015. As a business owner myself, it seemed
      to make the most sense to learn how to build a website rather than employing someone else to do so. Now that I have been with Galvanize
      for almost a year, I am excited to learn and grow in a deeper understanding of the members and students I interact with daily.
      Zero is pretty accurate description of where I started from, but I'm always up for a new challenge, and who knows? Maybe I find my
      calling in coding. </p>
